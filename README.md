# Overarching goal
_*Investigate forest cover change across protected areas.*_


# Challenge aims
- Map forest cover change from the Hansen et al. Database for your group's protected area as well for the larger region surrounding the protected area
- Create a figure in R visualising the amounts of forest cover change over time
- Report the state of forests in your group's protected area in a Markdown document


_Use this document as a template to fill in as you progress through the challenge._

# Title

_*Change of Forest Cover around Pink Lake in Western Australia*_


# Authors

_*Mariana Heredia Gómez, Megan Long, Jamie Fielding, Hanwei Liu, Mako Shibata, Sorcha Hicks*_

# Research question
__How much forest cover loss and gain has occurred in your protected area?__


# Introduction

_*Introduce the reader to your park and research questions that you are testing during this challenge in 200 words or fewer. You can include a few references if you would like.*_


# Workflow

_*Write out or draw your workflow in text here, on paper or in a ppt slide and then take a photo of that to include.*_


# Specific hypotheses and predictions

_*What do you know about this protected area?  What sort of factors could influence forest cover change in this part of the world?*_


# Methods

_*We extracted dataset **forest_change_Pink_Lake** from Google Earth Engine.  *_


# Data vis and summary methods

_*Describe your data visualisation, any mathematical summaries and/or any statistical methods that you used in brief. Include any relevant R code snippets.*_

```r
Your code
```

# 1. Maps of forest cover change for your protected area

_*Describe your results using appropriate scientific writing. Include maps of your protected area with informative captions.*_

_*Your maps*_


# 2. Visualisation of the amount of forest cover loss and gain for your protected area
```forest_tidy <- forest_tidy %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(loss, gain),
    names_to = "type",
    values_to = "area_km2"
  )

ggplot(forest_tidy, aes(x = year, y = area_km2, fill = type)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") + 
  labs(title = "Forest cover loss and gain in Pink Lake (2001-2016)",
       x = "Year", 
       y = "Area (km2)",
       fill= "Type")+
  theme_minimal()```

__*Your text and/or figures.*__


# 3. How do your results compare with your predictions? What do you think might explain the patterns you found?

_*Use your scientific and critical thinking skills to provide a conclusion summary statement of how land cover is changing across the protected area that you studied.*_

__*Your text and/or figures.*__


# 4. What other datasets, available within the GEE, could you use to test the potential drivers of forest cover change in your group's protected area that you identified in point #3. ?

_*Browse through the GEE Data catalogue and provide a link to your chosen dataset with a brief statement about why you chose it. Note you don't need to do analyses with this new dataset, you are just making a suggestion for future studies.*_

__*Link and description of your chosen dataset*__

_*BONUS! If you have the time, for some bonus recognition, map your chosen dataset in the GEE and include a visualisation of the dataset for your protected area (screencap from GEE).*_


# 5. What research question and hypotheses would you test with those additional datasets in your proposed future research and why does that research matter for the park management?

_*Add your answer here.*_


# Conclusions

_*Summarise what you have found in this challenge and its broader implications.*_
